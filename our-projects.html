            <article>
                <p>
                    The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France. It is named
                    after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed and built the tower.
                    Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed from 1887 to 1889 as
                    the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair and was initially criticized by some of France's leading
                    artists and intellectuals for its design, but it has become a global cultural icon of France and one
                    of the most recognizable structures in the world. The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with
                    an entrance fee in the world; 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. The Tower was made a Monument
                    historique in 1964 and named part of UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seins") in
                    1991.<br>
                    The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building, and the
                    tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During
                    its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made
                    structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in New York City
                    was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the 200-metre and
                    300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of the tower in
                    1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the
                    Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.

        <h2 id="2">British Columbia Parliament Buildings</h2>
        <article>
            <p>​​​​​​The British Columbia Parliament Buildings are the home of the Legislative Assembly of British
                Columbia and seat of the provincial government. The politics that have taken place within its long
                hallways, richly furnished rooms, and grand Legislative Chamber have had lasting impacts on generations
                of British Columbians, and will continue to do so well into the future. But to really understand the
                significance of the Parliament Buildings as they exist today, its important to understand their history
                throughout the past 120 years.​<br>
                The history of the Parliament Buildings can be broken down into several periods or events, each having a
                lasting impact on the next.</p>

        <article>
            <p>
                The Marine Building is a skyscraper located at 355 Burrard Street in Downtown Vancouver, British
                Columbia, Canada near the Financial District. Completed in 1930, at the time of its opening it was the
                city's tallest skyscraper and it is one of the most iconic buildings in Vancouver and listed among the
                best Art Deco buildings in the world.It owes its name to the plethora of fine marine-themed
                ornaments that decorate it. Because of its iconic architecture and luscious interior decorations, the
                building has been chosen as the setting of a number of film and television productions.
